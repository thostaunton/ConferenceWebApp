Use Visual studio to make changes and run this project locally.
In VS Select the IIS Express button in toolbar, to build and run the app in debug mode. Alternatively, press F5, or go to Debug > Start Debugging from the menu bar.

If you get an error message that says Unable to connect to web server 'IIS Express', close Visual Studio and then relaunch the program as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the Visual Studio icon from the Start Menu, and then selecting the Run as administrator option from the context menu.

You might also get a message that asks if you want to accept an IIS SSL Express certificate. To view the code in a web browser, select Yes, and then select Yes if you receive a follow-up security warning message.
